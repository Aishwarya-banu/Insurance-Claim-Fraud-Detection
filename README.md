# Insurance Fraud Detection using Machine Learning and Tableau

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent insurance claims using a real-world dataset containing over 1,000 records and 40+ features, including claim details, customer profiles, and incident metadata. The objective was to build interpretable machine learning models and interactive dashboards to identify patterns in fraudulent behavior.

## Project Highlights

- Built classification models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ensemble Voting
- Applied SMOTE for class imbalance handling
- Performed preprocessing with SimpleImputer and StandardScaler
- Evaluated models using confusion matrix, classification report, and fraud probability scores
- Interpreted feature importance to identify fraud risk drivers
- Designed interactive Tableau dashboards featuring:
  - Fraud distribution by state
  - Claim severity by incident type
  - Fraud rate by vehicle make
  - Filters for incident type, region, and auto make
